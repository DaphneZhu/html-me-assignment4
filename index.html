                        We all know <a href="https://www.slsc.org/" title = "">St. Louis Science Center</a>
                         is free to get in and why should someone get the
                         <a href="https://www.slsc.org/join-give/become-a-member/" title = "">Membership</a>? 
                         And why I put it on my #1 money worth list? It's worth the time read thorough my reasons. First, let's do some simply calculations here.  
                         Numbers are my best friends when it comes to value comparisions. If we have a family of four, two parents and two kids, 
                         one is 2 and one is 5. The family plan to spend their Saturday in the Science Center because it's a cold winter day. 
                         Here is their plan:    
                         
                                                10-11 am: discovery-room                                        $20.00
                                                11-12 am: a cute educational panda show at omnimax-theater      $39.80
                                                1-2   pm: free explore 
                                                paking (the free parking lot is full becuase the weather)       $10.00
                                                                                                    total       $68.80
                         
                          
                          Let's take a look at 
                         <a href="https://www.slsc.org/join-give/become-a-member/" title = "">Membership</a> 
                         price first.  For $89 per year, you can get Family & friends level, which includes FREE 
                         <a href="https://www.slsc.org/visit/directions-parking/" title ="">PARKING</a>

                          for this level of membership, which will cost $7.95-10.95/adult and $6.95-8.95/child depend on the show.  
                         $69.80 for one day vs. $89 all year long free parking and free discovery-room tickets.  Parents who have kids enjoy science and learning 
                         would find the membership is so worth the money.  Plus, if the family ever travel to other cities, St. Louis Science Center is affilicated with 
                         most other science museums in the country, some are even international affilications.  You can get in for FREE if you are a member for most of them.  
                         Check the <a href="https://www.astc.org/passport/" title="">ASTC</a>
                         website for more details when making your travel plans.  It can easily save hundrends of dollars if you are planning to visit 
                         local science realted museums.

                    <h3>#2 The Magic House Membership </h3>

                        <img src="images/magic-house-exterior.jpg" alt="The Magic House - St. Louis Children's Museum" width="1000" height= "500">

                        <p>
                         <a href="https://www.magichouse.org/" title="">The Magic House</a>is a magical place for kids.  It's my little one's favorite 
                         place to go since she was 1.  The 
                         place is built base on hands-on concepts.  It encourages kids to explore their 5 senses, opening their minds toward 
                         science and technology, literature and art, exploring their physical ability safely.  It's the first I would recommand to 
                         moms who have young kids.  The only reason it's on the number 2 list is the price, $150 for <a href="https://www.magichouse.org/membership/membership-levels/" title="">family membership</a> 
                         with two parents 
                         and all the kis who live in the same hosuehold.  $150/year is not very attractive number. However, the Magic House has a special
                         50% sale for it's membership twice/year. One is in August, and one is in November. Plus, it's affilicated with 200 ACM network which
                         can save 50% on the tickets. Compare to the <a href="https://www.magichouse.org/plan-a-visit/" title="">daily admission</a> $12/person (age one and up), 
                         for a family of four, two parents and two kids, 
                         one is 2 and one is 5. $12 x 4 = $48 / visit vs $150/ year with unlimited visits, not mention if they get it on the sales day. More kids one family have, more money they can save to 
                         be a member. It's a great Christmas gift idea or birthday gift for in-laws who have young kids.

                        <p>
                          Missouri Botanical Garden is one of the places where you can get the most amazing scenary pictures in St. Louis.  Being the 
                          second largest botancial garden in North America, it's a home of many plants.  If you enjoy nature like I do, it's definitely a 
                          must membership to have in your wallet.  How about kids then? 
                         The<a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/learn-discover/youth-families/just-for-kids/visit-us/doris-i.-schnuck-childrens-garden.aspx" title="">
                         Children's Garden</a> is an outdoor advanture for kids to explore the beauty of the nature.  The down side is that the children's Garden 
                         opens from April - October each year.  It closes in other months due to the weather.  

                          The great thing about the <a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/" title="membership for Missouri Botanical Garden"></a> membership for Missouri 
                          Botanical Garden is that one membership for three accesses. $75 for a family membership, it gives the accesses to 
                          <a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/visit/family-of-attractions/butterfly-house.aspx" title="">Butterfly House</a>  and
                         <a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/visit/family-of-attractions/shaw-nature-reserve.aspx" title="">Shaw Nature Reserve</a>. 
                         Butterfly House sits next to 
                         <a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/visit/family-of-attractions/shaw-nature-reserve.aspx" title="">Faust Park and St. Louis Carousel</a>.
                         It offers many kids educational programs all year long. Although the facility is small, with the park next by and St. Louis Carousel in a walking distance,
                         kids will have a great fun day.  Now let's do some calculations why the membership is worth the money. For a family of four, two parents and two kids, 
                         one is 2 and one is 5. Botanical Graden offer free admission to St. Louis County residents on Wednesdays and Saturdays before noon. 
                         We assume that you are a St. Louis County residents, you would like to go there on Saturday Morning, it only left Butterfly House and Shaw Nature Reserve.
                         Butterfly House   $8x 2 adults= $16  $5x2 kids = $10  $16+$10 = $26
                         Shaw Nature Reserve $5 x 2 adults = $10
                                    total                    $36 
                         $36 for visit the places once a year.  With $75, you can get unlimited accesses to all three places all year long.

                         Being a member of public museums and parks is not only being a beneficiary of discounts, but also a way to support our community. 
                         The museums and parks are the results of collections of human effort and wisdom and we can be part of it.
